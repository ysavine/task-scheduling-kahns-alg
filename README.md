Motivating Question: How can graph theory algorithms be applied in the context of project management?

Kahns Algorithm: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kahns-algorithm-in-python/#:~:text=Kahn's%20Algorithm%20is%20used%20for,them%20in%20a%20topological%20order.

Task: You are an average Duke student with a secret superpower – multitasking. You can work on any number of tasks at any given moment and are trying to figure out how to use this ability to tackle your to-do list as quickly as possible.

Some of the tasks you have can only be completed after the other ones (for example, you have to first conduct literature review, then outline the essay, and finally write it). Each task has an associated time that you predict it should take. You can start working on any task whenever you want, if all of the “preparational” tasks are already completed.

Your goal is to come up with the optimal order of tasks, and let your friends know in how many hours you’ll be free to go out for ice cream in Pincho Loco. Here is your todo list! 

Leetcode 2050. Parellel Courses III approaches a similar scenario, and can also be tackled using Kahn's Algorithm!
